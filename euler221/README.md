# Problem #221: Alexandrian Integers 

## Problem Statement 

We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there exist integers p, q, r such that:

A = p · q · r    and  
   

1A
=

1p
+

1q
+

1r
For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer (p = 5, q = −7, r = −18).
In fact, 630 is the 6th Alexandrian integer,  the first 6 Alexandrian integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420 and 630.
Find the 150000th Alexandrian integer.
