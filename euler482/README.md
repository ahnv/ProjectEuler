# Problem #482: The incenter of a triangle 

## Problem Statement 


ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.
The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. 


Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|. 


Let S(P) = ∑L for all such triangles where p ≤ P. For example, S(103) = 3619.


Find S(107).
