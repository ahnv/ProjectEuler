# Problem #496: Incenter and circumcenter of triangle 

## Problem Statement 

Given an integer sided triangle ABC:
Let I be the incenter of ABC.
Let D be the intersection between the line AI and the circumcircle of ABC (A ≠ D).
We define F(L) as the sum of BC for the triangles ABC that satisfy AC = DI and BC ≤ L.
For example, F(15) = 45 because the triangles ABC with (BC,AC,AB) = (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16) satisfy the conditions.
Find F(109).
