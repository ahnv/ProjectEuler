# Problem #536: Modulo power identity  

## Problem Statement 


Let S(n) be the sum of all positive integers m not exceeding n having the following property:a m+4 ≡ a (mod m) for all integers a.


The values of m ≤ 100 that satisfy this property are 1, 2, 3, 5 and 21, thus S(100) = 1+2+3+5+21 = 32.
You are given S(106) = 22868117.


Find S(1012).
